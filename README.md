# About me! 🐧

Exploring is an ever present part of my life as a Developer, check out new libraries and languages and play around with it to get a better idea and maybe use something I played around with in production one day?

# Goals for 2022! ⚽

* Create a couple of Flutter Applications!
* Create a couple of Kotlin, Koltin Native and Kotlin Multiplatform Applications.
* Play around with Elixir and Rust.
* Play around with Swing and JavaFX.
* Maintain and create a few Discord Bots
